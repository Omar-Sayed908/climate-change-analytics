# 🌍 Climate Analytics Dashboard – Data Analyst Project

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Climate Analytics Dashboard** provides insights into global and national environmental indicators such as CO₂ emissions, water quality, and energy consumption.  
It aims to reveal how human activities and climate-related factors correlate with sustainable development metrics like clean water access and renewable energy adoption.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical **CO₂ emissions** and **energy consumption** trends.
- Evaluate **water quality** and **access to safe drinking water** globally.
- Identify **correlations** between emissions, water quality, and urbanization.
- Highlight **climate-driven risks** using a set of integrated KPIs.
- Present findings using clear, interactive, and meaningful **visual dashboards**.
